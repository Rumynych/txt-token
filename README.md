Imports necessary libraries: nltk for natural language processing, re for regular expressions, and json for working with JSON objects.

Checks that the necessary NLTK data is downloaded. If not, it downloads it.

Defines a function tokenize_text(text) that takes a string text as input and returns a JSON object containing each word in the text and the sentences in which it appears.

The tokenize_text(text) function first splits the text into individual sentences using sent_tokenize(text) from the nltk.tokenize module.

It then creates an empty dictionary word_dict to store the words and their sentences.

For each sentence in the text, the function tokenizes the sentence into individual words using word_tokenize(sentence) from the nltk.tokenize module.

The function then filters out any stop words (common words like "the" and "and" that are usually not useful for analysis) and unwanted words (like punctuation marks and numbers) using a list comprehension that iterates over the words and checks that each word is not in the set of English stop words

(stopwords.words('english')) and that it doesn't consist entirely of non-word characters (using re.match('^[\W_]+$', word)).

The function then loops over the filtered words and adds each word and the index of the sentence in which it appears to the word_dict. If a word is already in the dictionary, the function adds the index of the sentence to the list of sentences in which the word appears.

Finally, the word_dict is converted to a JSON object using json.dumps(word_dict) and returned.

An example usage of the function is provided, where the text variable contains a sample string to be tokenized. When thetokenize_text(text) function is called with this string as input, it prints the resulting JSON object to the console.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of tokenizing English text into words and grouping the words by the sentences in which they appear. It also filters out stop words and unwanted words to improve the quality of the results
